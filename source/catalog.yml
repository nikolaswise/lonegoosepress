    title: 'There is magic in the physical presence of books, and the methodical setting of ink on paper.'
    description:
    - 'What other technology for communication has persisted and thrived for over 500 years, transforming cultures around the world in countless ways, fostering education and many struggles for freedom and justice? lone goose press is dedicated to keeping that tradition alive in a tangible way.'
    - 'Since 1989, lone goose press has been publishing limited letterpress works, printed broadsides and hand bound books. With this slow, exacting work, owner Sandy Tilcock continues to honor the highest standards in traditional book arts.'
    - 'Why engage in letterpress printing at a time when technology allows instantaneous multimedia communication on a mass scale?'
    - 'Today’s revolutionary innovation is tomorrow’s ordinary convenience that we soon take for granted. While we use and appreciate the wonders of digital media and internet communication, we want to invoke a quieter, more contemplative approach to the sharing of ideas and passions.'
    - 'The mission of lone goose press is to promote book arts, to celebrate outstanding writing, and to foster conversation about community, social justice and environmental ethics.'
  commisions:
    title: 'Commisions'
    description:
    - 'lone goose press welcomes commission work. Sandy has over 25 years experience in designing and producing books, broadsides, commemorative awards and other book arts endeavors on commission. These may be editions or one-of-a-kind works. Each project is unique, and the collaborative process with the client often yields unexpected rewards.'
    - 'Sandy brings an extensive background and experience in typography and book design to each printing project. The means of setting text and imagery on paper may include both letterpress and digital printing techniques.'
    - 'Grounded in both French and English binding traditions, Sandy takes an eclectic, innovative approach to determine the most appropriate means of bringing the concept to fulfillment. Binding features may include a wide variety of bookcloth and leather, decorated papers, dyed endsheets and hand-sewn headbands, as the project requires. lone goose bindings and enclosures have won awards and are known for their elegance, precision and attention to detail. They reflect the principle that form follows function, and are executed so that books open freely and are easily read.'
    - 'Sandy relishes the craft of boxmaking. Her innovative designs and impeccable execution of enclosures has earned the respect of collectors, artists, photographers, printmakers and others across the country. She has adapted the basic clamshell box design in a variety of ways. Some of her boxes have included drawers and other additional compartments, special structures to accommodate wedge-shaped books, and to house and display sculptural works and jewelry. Features may include inlaid labels and magnetic closures. Boxes larger than 11" x 14" have a double-wall construction with lapped joints, creating a very strong enclosure.'
    design:
      title: 'Design'
      description: 'The client presents a task/project in which they know what they want to accomplish and the "look" they want. I listen, distill what they have said, research options and pertinent information. Then I present a proposal (possibly two), discuss with them, refine the chosen proposal if necessary and then provide an estimate for the realization of the project. Once the design is settled I gather necessary the materials, select subcontractors such as lettering artists and go into production.'
    publication:
      title: 'Publishing'
      description: 'Recognizing the influx of self-publishing I am prepared to offer my services to those who wish to enter into a self-publishing project. These services may include but are not limited to consultation, design of the work, selection of the best production approach, and other services as needed.'
    realization:
      title: 'Realization'
      description: 'The client presents the project, designed by them. I then determine the best approach to accomplish their project, present them a budget and proceed to perform the tasks involved if approved. This may include letterpress printing, digital printing, binding and other processes as necessary. I may arrange to subcontract for work that is not done in the studio.'
  publications:
    title: 'Publications'
    description: 'The core of the press’s work is rooted in a passion for traditional forms and methods of setting words on paper. It is about creating beautiful, valued artifacts, but always in service of the text. Any imagery is carefully selected and incorporated to honor the author’s words. The goal is to produce a worthy vessel for writings with urgency and relevance for our time. For the most part the texts are contemporary; the techniques are consistent with those common prior to the industrial expansion of the publishing industry.'
    ephemera:
      title: 'Chapbooks and Ephemera'
      description: 'Some lone goose press publications take the form of small booklets or chapbooks. In earlier centuries such inexpensive works, featuring illustrated poems and stories, were sold by itinerant peddlers, outside the mainstream of commercial book production. Keepsakes may be various kinds of small, intimate printed items produced in editions for specific events, or just for the sheer pleasure of setting ink on paper. The press also produces ephemera such as our traditional “Weathergrams” which are shared among friends and may be given to guests at studio events or receptions.'
    flags:
      title: 'Poetic Prayer Flags'
      description: 'This special project of the press brings together brief pieces of writing by various authors in a format inspired by the Tibetan tradition of prayer flags. The writings may be new or excerpted from previous works. We ask the authors to consider themes of hope, peace, reconciliation, and respect for nature. The series is ongoing, each piece having the same format so that several flags may be strung together. This effort springs from a desire to cultivate visions for the future that counterbalance the despair and cynicism that often seem to prevail in our society.'
    broadsides:
      title: 'Broadsides'
      description:
      - 'From the earliest days of movable type, printers have worked with the limits presented by the size and format of the press, producing a single sheet of printed paper at a time. While this process was quickly adapted for the printing of books, the single­sheet format was often used for official announcements and proclamations. As the technology became more widely available, it also became a vehicle for political agitation. Dissident printers in back­alley shops sometimes cranked out calls for insurrection or reproduced scaffold speeches by condemned prisoners. The term broadside continues to carry the connotation of challenging the prevailing structures of power and ideology.'
      - 'While lone goose press’s approach to broadsides may be more reflective than inflammatory, we tend to seek poems or short prose essays that challenge us to perceive a deeper understanding of citizenship in this world.'
    books:
      title: 'Books'
      description: 'lone goose press owner Sandy Tilcock achieved recognition as a bookbinder and designer of limited­ edition books prior to her introduction to letterpress printing. Her books reflect her priority for honoring the text. All the elements—typography, design, imagery, materials and binding methods are integrated in service to the author’s words. lone goose press books are conceived as collaborations with authors, and where commissioned artwork is used, with artists. Sandy’s limited edition books have achieved international recognition for their design, creative use of materials, precise typography and attention to detail.'
books:
  - title: 'Grandfather Was a Good Witch: Growing Up Cherokee'
    author: 'Rennard Strickland and Jack Gregory'
    artist: 'Margot Voorhies Thompson'
    description:
    - 'Michael Bixler’s monotype-cast Gill Sans type, then passed through the composing stick for justification; computer-set Neuland for the display type and printed using polymer plates on Nideggen paper.'
    - 'Sewn binding with a supported paper wrapper made from a handmade pigmented and dyed flax paper (Walnut Red) by Cave Papers. The artist cut the original images large in Rubylith film. Commissioned by Rennard Strickland.'
    - 'One of my favorite commissions. Rennard Strickland was retiring from teaching and being Dean at the School of Law, University of Oregon. He was marking the end of 40 years of teaching and wished to publish his 40th book in conjunction with his retirement. He commissioned me to do this and I gladly accepted the challenge.'
    - 'The story grew from what Rennard writes “may be our greatest literary failure.” After the publication of Strickland’s and Gregory’s first book, _Sam Houston with the Cherokees_, in 1966, they received a phone call from an editor at Random House asking if they would do a “children’s book on what it’s like to be an Indian.”'
    - 'They agreed to undertake the task and took a tape recorder out into the field to gather impressions and experiences. They interviewed more than two dozen Cherokee men who had come of age during the Great Depression. Reels and reels of tape and dozens of letters later, the New York editor decided Strickland’s and Gregory’s Indians did not meet her stereotype of what it was like to be Indian. By mutual agreement, the project was called off.'
    - 'Strickland and Gregory gathered those stories into one narrative. A slightly different version was published in 1972 by the Indian Heritage Association. This publication was the first printing of the original narrative.'
    - 'Rennard enjoys the whole process of making a book, from writing to fine-tuning the text, selecting papers (he loved “fondling” paper), typeface, images, etc. He is an absolute joy to work with.'

    release: '2013'

    description:
    - 'The director of the Oregon Bach Festival asked me to create a special farewell gift for founding Artistic Director Helmuth Rilling on the occasion of his retirement after 44 years. The Festival had commissioned a choral piece by Scottish composer James MacMillan titled _Alleluia_ dedicated to Mr. Rilling. The request was to create an elegant binding for the score that would allow Mr. Rilling to conduct from it if he so chose. The bound score was to be presented in a box that would also accommodate a CD of the inaugural performance.'
    - 'To make the book, I created a digital rendering of the score on paper resembling the manuscript paper used by composers, preserving its handwritten impression. I commissioned calligrapher Marilyn Reaves to create gesture drawings based on conducting patterns, which were incorporated into the backing sheets of the score pages. The conducting patterns reflect the 4/4 meter of the work, also referencing Helmuth Rilling’s 44-year tenure with the Festival. The completed accordion-style binding is 17 inches high, and the pages, if fully unfolded, extend 20 feet.'
    - 'The box is a traditional clamshell box in which the upper tray encloses the compact disc in a concentric ring structure resembling an amphitheater. On the exterior, I inlaid three panels of fused glass with a gingko leaf motif, by artist Susan Price. Susan, a longtime friend and supporter of the Bach Festival, wished to honor Helmuth Rilling’s work with an image symbolizing longevity, resilience, hope and peace.'

    - 'I was asked to design a box that houses 5 custom prints which are strings with knots embedded between 2 sheets of handmade abaca paper by the artist, the strings going beyond the edges of the paper at random points. I was also to print a poem by Carl Adamshick on a sheet of the abaca paper for the colophon page.'
    - 'I started with a standard clamshell box design with narrow walls since only 6 sheets of paper were to be housed. The lower tray was constructed such that the strings are accommodated within the tray. The problem to solve was how to stabilize the sheets of paper. The solution was to fabricate 4 corners which framed the edges of paper but allow the strings to lie outside the edges of the paper. The depth and width of the lower tray was done such that a panel on the spine of the box (spine baffle) would fit snugly inside the open edge to insure no dust could find its way inside, and a panel inside the upper tray would fit snugly inside the tray to gently hold the sheets in place so there is no movement of the artwork.'
    - 'A window is cut into the upper board of the case which allows the placement of a small "String Theory" label which is mounted on a pedestal yet is below the surface of the board so there is no wear.'

    description: "I was asked by the University of Oregon's Jordan Schnitzer Museum of Art to design and produce an award that the Museum would give annually to those who made a significant contribution to the museum, either as a volunteer or in another capacity. It was to be named the Gertrude Bass Warner Award, honoring the history of the building. The museum was built in 1933 to house the Murray Warner Collection of Oriental Art—more than 3,700 works of art given to the University of Oregon by Gertrude Bass Warner. The award was to be of an intimate scale, and either be hung on a wall or easily tucked into a bookshelf. It was also to incorporate a photo of Gertrude Bass Warner taken on her travels, and text provided by museum staff. They also wanted a logo-like image designed for the museum that was contemporary but evoked the look of an east Asian “chop” or signature. I had 3 weeks to design and execute this award."

    - 'Florida Jeweler Tom McCarthy received a commission for a special necklace in white and yellow gold. The necklace he created was reversible and incorporated a pendant that could be be removed and worn independently on a chain. Tom asked me to create a one-of-a-kind box to house and present the necklace. Since it was not feasible for Tom to ship the necklace across the continent, I was to work from a to-scale drawing.'

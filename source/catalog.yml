    title: 'There is magic in the physical presence of books, and the methodical setting of ink on paper.'
    description:
    - 'What other technology for communication has persisted and thrived for over 500 years, transforming cultures around the world in countless ways, fostering education and many struggles for freedom and justice? lone goose press is dedicated to keeping that tradition alive in a tangible way.'
    - 'Since 1989, lone goose press has been publishing limited letterpress works, printed broadsides and hand bound books. With this slow, exacting work, owner Sandy Tilcock continues to honor the highest standards in traditional book arts.'
    - 'Why engage in letterpress printing at a time when technology allows instantaneous multimedia communication on a mass scale?'
    - 'Today’s revolutionary innovation is tomorrow’s ordinary convenience that we soon take for granted. While we use and appreciate the wonders of digital media and internet communication, we want to invoke a quieter, more contemplative approach to the sharing of ideas and passions.'
    - 'The mission of lone goose press is to promote book arts, to celebrate outstanding writing, and to foster conversation about community, social justice and environmental ethics.'
  commisions:
    title: 'Commisions'
    description:
    - 'lone goose press welcomes commission work. Sandy has over 25 years experience in designing and producing books, broadsides, commemorative awards and other book arts endeavors on commission. These may be editions or one-of-a-kind works. Each project is unique, and the collaborative process with the client often yields unexpected rewards.'
    - 'Sandy brings an extensive background and experience in typography and book design to each printing project. The means of setting text and imagery on paper may include both letterpress and digital printing techniques.'
    - 'Grounded in both French and English binding traditions, Sandy takes an eclectic, innovative approach to determine the most appropriate means of bringing the concept to fulfillment. Binding features may include a wide variety of bookcloth and leather, decorated papers, dyed endsheets and hand-sewn headbands, as the project requires. lone goose bindings and enclosures have won awards and are known for their elegance, precision and attention to detail. They reflect the principle that form follows function, and are executed so that books open freely and are easily read.'
    - 'Sandy relishes the craft of boxmaking. Her innovative designs and impeccable execution of enclosures has earned the respect of collectors, artists, photographers, printmakers and others across the country. She has adapted the basic clamshell box design in a variety of ways. Some of her boxes have included drawers and other additional compartments, special structures to accommodate wedge-shaped books, and to house and display sculptural works and jewelry. Features may include inlaid labels and magnetic closures. Boxes larger than 11" x 14" have a double-wall construction with lapped joints, creating a very strong enclosure.'
    design:
      title: 'Design'
      description:
      - 'The client presents a task/project in which they know what they want to accomplish and the "look" they want. I listen, distill what they have said, research options and pertinent information. Then I present a proposal (possibly two), discuss with them, refine the chosen proposal if necessary and then provide an estimate for the realization of the project. Once the design is settled I gather necessary the materials, select subcontractors such as lettering artists and go into production.'
    publication:
      title: 'Publishing Support'
      description:
      - 'lone goose press provides quality self-publishing support drawing on decades of experience as a publisher. A wide range of services are available and pricing is determined on a project by project basis. References are available upon request.'
      - 'The process begins with an extensive interview with the client regarding goals, expectations and the project’s support needs. Services can include: production facility selection, project management, cover design, text layout, proofreading, ISBN and Library of Congress registration, as well as professional recommendations regarding marketing and distribution options.'
    realization:
      title: 'Realization'
      description:
      - 'The client presents the project, designed by them. I then determine the best approach to accomplish their project, present them a budget and proceed to perform the tasks involved if approved. This may include letterpress printing, digital printing, binding and other processes as necessary. I may arrange to subcontract for work that is not done in the studio.'
  publications:
    title: 'Publications'
    description: 'The core of the press’s work is rooted in a passion for traditional forms and methods of setting words on paper. It is about creating beautiful, valued artifacts, but always in service of the text. Any imagery is carefully selected and incorporated to honor the author’s words. The goal is to produce a worthy vessel for writings with urgency and relevance for our time. For the most part the texts are contemporary; the techniques are consistent with those common prior to the industrial expansion of the publishing industry.'
    ephemera:
      title: 'Chapbooks and Ephemera'
      description: 'Some lone goose press publications take the form of small booklets or chapbooks. In earlier centuries such inexpensive works, featuring illustrated poems and stories, were sold by itinerant peddlers, outside the mainstream of commercial book production. Keepsakes may be various kinds of small, intimate printed items produced in editions for specific events, or just for the sheer pleasure of setting ink on paper. The press also produces ephemera such as our traditional “Weathergrams” which are shared among friends and may be given to guests at studio events or receptions.'
    flags:
      title: 'Poetic Prayer Flags'
      description: 'This special project of the press brings together brief pieces of writing by various authors in a format inspired by the Tibetan tradition of prayer flags. The writings may be new or excerpted from previous works. We ask the authors to consider themes of hope, peace, reconciliation, and respect for nature. The series is ongoing, each piece having the same format so that several flags may be strung together. This effort springs from a desire to cultivate visions for the future that counterbalance the despair and cynicism that often seem to prevail in our society.'
    broadsides:
      title: 'Broadsides'
      description:
      - 'From the earliest days of movable type, printers have worked with the limits presented by the size and format of the press, producing a single sheet of printed paper at a time. While this process was quickly adapted for the printing of books, the single­sheet format was often used for official announcements and proclamations. As the technology became more widely available, it also became a vehicle for political agitation. Dissident printers in back­ alley shops sometimes cranked out calls for insurrection or reproduced scaffold speeches by condemned prisoners. The term broadside continues to carry the connotation of challenging the prevailing structures of power and ideology.'
      - 'While lone goose press’s approach to broadsides may be more reflective than inflammatory, we tend to seek poems or short prose essays that challenge us to perceive a deeper understanding of citizenship in this world.'
    books:
      title: 'Books'
      description: 'lone goose press owner Sandy Tilcock achieved recognition as a bookbinder and designer of limited­ edition books prior to her introduction to letterpress printing. Her books reflect her priority for honoring the text. All the elements—typography, design, imagery, materials and binding methods are integrated in service to the author’s words. lone goose press books are conceived as collaborations with authors, and where commissioned artwork is used, with artists. Sandy’s limited edition books have achieved international recognition for their design, creative use of materials, precise typography and attention to detail.'

    - 'In April 2015, Sandy Tilcock and Portland artist Margot Thompson used a 2-week residency at PLAYA, on Summer Lake in central Oregon to develop Poking Around. This limited-edition artist’s book is based on an essay by Kathleen Dean Moore on the value of wandering with curiosity.'
    - 'This book is imbued with the Playa landscape both physically and conceptually. Sandy and Margot walked the lake shore and hiked the nearby forests, observing, photographing and collecting, practicing the kind of mindful exploration the essay celebrates. Back in their studios, they developed the images and design ideas for the book. Margot’s drawings embrace the patterns of the lake bed and objects found on their daily forays. They used crushed sandstone from Winter Ridge to create a slurry which was brushed on paper to create the earthy background for the pages. This texture was reproduced digitally to produce the edition.'
    - 'The text type is Gill Sans and the display type is Castellar. An Epson 4880 ink jet printer was used to print the page backgrounds. The type and drawings were printed from photopolymer relief plates on a Vandercook 219 proof press. Papeterie Saint-Armand of Montréal, Québec, Canada, made the paper, Canal white. The cover paper, Red Walnut, is a handmade paper from Cave Papers of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Sandy Tilcock hand-colored the title and paragraph breaks. Margot Voorhies Thompson decorated the covers and Sandy Tilcock executed the binding.'
    - 'To learn more about Tilcock’s and Thompson’s collaborative residency at PLAYA read Catherine Woodard’s Best American Poetry blog post from October 9, 2015.'

    - 'The limited edition, letterpress book <em>All of Him</em> was a true collaboration, evolving over a period of four years. The intense, intimate poems deal with Michael and Matthew Dickman’s loss of their older brother to a drug overdose. In this video, the poets read excerpts from the work, and artist Keith Achepohl and designer/printer Sandy Tilcock talk about the genesis and development of this unique publication.'
    - 'The types used are handset Gill Sans for the poems and colophon. Computer generated Beata and Gill Sans Light were used for the display types and printed from polymer plates. The types, handset and polymer, were printed on a Vandercook 219 proofing press. Sandy Tilcock, lone goose press proprietor designed, printed and “bound” the book.'
    - 'Papers used are Rives BFK, off-white, for the text pages and Saint-Armand’s Black Denim Canal made from clothing industry offcuts for the chemise. The cloth for the box is Duo Graphite from Bamberger Kaliko Textiles in Germany.'
    - 'The original images are individual trace monotypes which were scanned and adjusted in Photoshop so they would be suitable for the making of polymer photogravure plates. Many images were made for each poem. Sandy Tilcock, selected the final images used and laid them out on the page for each poem. Once the layout was finalized the adjusted image file was sent to Intaglio Editions of Boulder, Colorado where the polymer plates were made by Jon Lybrook. The plates were editioned by Sandy Tilcock and Nikolas Wise in the lone goose press studio.'
    - 'lone goose press thanks all those who guided and assisted the press in the production of the book: Keith Achepohl for his wonderful, thoughtful images; Jon Lybrook for his teaching the press how to prepare the files for the images; Russ Dodd of Portland, Oregon for providing a tutorial in printing and editioning photopolymer photogravures; and Nikolas Wise for his amazing skill at wiping plates such that there was no plate tone. And, many thanks to Michael and Matthew Dickman for entrusting lone goose press with the manuscript.'

    author: 'Rennard Strickland and Jack Gregory'

    description:
    - 'Michael Bixler’s monotype-cast Gill Sans type, then passed through the composing stick for justification; computer-set Neuland for the display type and printed using polymer plates on Nideggen paper.'
    - 'Sewn binding with a supported paper wrapper made from a handmade pigmented and dyed flax paper (Walnut Red) by Cave Papers. The artist cut the original images large in Rubylith film. Commissioned by Rennard Strickland.'
    - 'One of my favorite commissions. Rennard Strickland was retiring from teaching and being Dean at the School of Law, University of Oregon. He was marking the end of 40 years of teaching and wished to publish his 40th book in conjunction with his retirement. He commissioned me to do this and I gladly accepted the challenge.'
    - 'The story grew from what Rennard writes “may be our greatest literary failure.” After the publication of Strickland’s and Gregory’s first book, <em>Sam Houston with the Cherokees</em>, in 1966, they received a phone call from an editor at Random House asking if they would do a “children’s book on what it’s like to be an Indian.”'
    - 'They agreed to undertake the task and took a tape recorder out into the field to gather impressions and experiences. They interviewed more than two dozen Cherokee men who had come of age during the Great Depression. Reels and reels of tape and dozens of letters later, the New York editor decided Strickland’s and Gregory’s Indians did not meet her stereotype of what it was like to be Indian. By mutual agreement, the project was called off.'
    - 'Strickland and Gregory gathered those stories into one narrative. A slightly different version was published in 1972 by the Indian Heritage Association. This publication was the first printing of the original narrative.'
    - 'Rennard enjoys the whole process of making a book, from writing to fine-tuning the text, selecting papers (he loved “fondling” paper), typeface, images, etc. He is an absolute joy to work with.'

Charles Hobson, of San Francisco, designed and organized the edition, which was printed by Susan Acker at Feathered Serpent Press, Novato, California. Nora Pauwels at the Kala Art Institute in Berkeley, California made the woodblocks into an edition. John DeMerritt, of Emeryville, California, hinged the text pages and bound the book. Sandy Tilcock of lone goose press, Eugene, Oregon, produced the boxes.'
    - 'This was an unusual project, in that I, Sandy Tilcock, did not have responsibility for all the production work but oversaw those who did the work and published it under the lone goose press imprint. It came about because the original publisher was unable to follow through due to illness. Robin was anxious to see the book completed and be included in a large exhibition based on Barry Lopez’s writings scheduled at a gallery in San Francisco. Barry approached me and asked if I would become the publisher and shepherd the project to completion. We had only three months to produce the book, so no one person would be able to do all the work. It became a team approach. As the publisher, my role was to assure that everyone was on task so we could meet the deadline. '

    image: 'design/obf/Rilling_Box_Cover.jpg'
    description:
    - 'The director of the Oregon Bach Festival asked me to create a special farewell gift for founding Artistic Director Helmuth Rilling on the occasion of his retirement after 44 years. The Festival had commissioned a choral piece by Scottish composer James MacMillan titled “Alleluia” dedicated to Mr. Rilling. The request was to create an elegant binding for the score that would allow Mr. Rilling to conduct from it if he so chose. The bound score was to be presented in a box that would also accommodate a CD of the inaugural performance.'
    - 'To make the book, I created a digital rendering of the score on paper resembling the manuscript paper used by composers, preserving its handwritten impression. I commissioned calligrapher Marilyn Reaves to create gesture drawings based on conducting patterns, which were incorporated into the backing sheets of the score pages. The conducting patterns reflect the 4/4 meter of the work, also referencing Helmuth Rilling’s 44-year tenure with the Festival. The completed accordion-style binding is 17 inches high, and the pages, if fully unfolded, extend 20 feet.'
    - 'The box is a traditional clamshell box in which the upper tray encloses the compact disc in a concentric ring structure resembling an amphitheater. On the exterior, I inlaid three panels of fused glass with a gingko leaf motif, by artist Susan Price. Susan, a longtime friend and supporter of the Bach Festival, wished to honor Helmuth Rilling’s work with an image symbolizing longevity, resilience, hope and peace.'

    description:
    - 'I was asked to design a box that houses 5 custom prints which are strings with knots embedded between 2 sheets of handmade abaca paper by the artist, the strings going beyond the edges of the paper at random points. I was also to print a poem by Carl Adamshick on a sheet of the abaca paper for the colophon page.'
    - 'I started with a standard clamshell box design with narrow walls since only 6 sheets of paper were to be housed. The lower tray was constructed such that the strings are accommodated within the tray. The problem to solve was how to stabilize the sheets of paper. The solution was to fabricate 4 corners which framed the edges of paper but allow the strings to lie outside the edges of the paper. The depth and width of the lower tray was done such that a panel on the spine of the box (spine baffle) would fit snugly inside the open edge to insure no dust could find its way inside, and a panel inside the upper tray would fit snugly inside the tray to gently hold the sheets in place so there is no movement of the artwork.'
    - 'A window is cut into the upper board of the case which allows the placement of a small "String Theory" label which is mounted on a pedestal yet is below the surface of the board so there is no wear.'

It was to be named the Gertrude Bass Warner Award, honoring the history of the building. The museum was built in 1933 to house the Murray Warner Collection of Oriental Art—more than 3,700 works of art given to the University of Oregon by Gertrude Bass Warner. The award was to be of an intimate scale, and either be hung on a wall or easily tucked into a bookshelf. It was also to incorporate a photo of Gertrude Bass Warner taken on her travels, and text provided by museum staff. They also wanted a logo-like image designed for the museum that was contemporary but evoked the look of an east Asian “chop” or signature. I had 3 weeks to design and execute this award."

    description:
    - 'The University of Oregon School of Architecture and Allied Arts commissioned me to design and print a "certificate" that the School would award to a distinguished alumnus each year at graduation. A lettering artist would add the recipient’s name and accomplishments each year. Design elements and a quote by Professor Lawrence were to be determined by me, with the approval of University staff. Later in the process they requested that a presentation folder be made each year using colors customized for each recipient.'
    - 'My first task was to learn more about Ellis Fuller Lawrence (1879-1946). Lawrence was an American architect who worked primarily in the state of Oregon. In 1914, he helped found and was the first dean of the University of Oregon’s School of Architecture and Allied Arts, a position he held until his death. Lawrence concurrently served as campus architect for the University of Oregon and designed many campus buildings, including Knight Library and the Jordan Schnitzer Museum of Art. '
    - 'Looking for a design element, I toured Lawrence’s buildings looking for distinguishing visual features. I decided to use the design of a concrete frieze that surrounds the entry door of the Museum of Art. I obtained high-resolution photos of the panel, and from these commissioned Judith Sparks to produce and ink drawing of the design which could be reproduced using relief plates. The client was so pleased with this selection that they chose to use this as the branding element of the award and all that went with it. This design was also used for a bronze medal that was designed and cast for the recipient.'
    - 'In search of a text I could use for the certificate, I spent several afternoons in the reading room of the University’s Special Collections and Archives reading through the personal writings and journals of Lawrence. I gained a deep appreciation for the man, his work and his belief in education. The quote used was taken from one of his personal journals.'
    - 'To integrate these elements, I chose a wide format and enhanced the "landscape" quality of this shape by hand tearing the top edge of the certificate to evoke a mountain range, suggesting the Oregon environment. I created a template, registered it to the rectangular print, and traced the mountain edge using a water charged brush to soften the fibers of the paper, allowing the top section to separate easily.'

    description:
    - 'Florida Jeweler Tom McCarthy received a commission for a special necklace in white and yellow gold. The necklace he created was reversible and incorporated a pendant that could be be removed and worn independently on a chain. Tom asked me to create a one-of-a-kind box to house and present the necklace. Since it was not feasible for Tom to ship the necklace across the continent, I was to work from a to-scale drawing.'
    - 'I designed a modified clamshell box which would allow storage of the pendant chain when not in use. The necklace is displayed on a riser with shapes cut to accommodate the necklace components. Within that structure is a lidded compartment for the chain. These components are flush, so that when the box is closed, the necklace is held securely in place. The top panel is held closed using a bone clasp which slips into a loop.'
    - 'Tom’s client was delighted with the necklace and the box, so much so she felt it needed to be shared with more than her circle of friends, and so decided to donate it to the Mint Museum in Charlotte, NC where it is a part of the Craft + Design Collection.'

    - 'Oregon artist, poet and naturalist Robin Brant Lodewick directed in her will that her previously unpublished poems be assembled in a book and distributed free to libraries across the continent. lone goose press took on the task of forming a coherent publication from a mass of typescripts. The first step was to contract for editing, selection and organization of the poems. The editor performed proofreading and corrections that appeared to best reflect the author’s intentions, and organized a selection of 60 poems in three sections by theme and subject matter, and provided a biographic commentary as an introduction to the volume, which was given the title <i>Rain Cycle.</i>'
    - 'For this manuscript, Sandy selected typefaces and a standard page design to accommodate the varied prose and poetic elements. Drawings by the author were used for a frontispiece and to mark the section divisions. After learning that Canadian Emily Carr was one of Ms. Lodewick’s favorite artists, the press located the owner of one of Carr’s paintings, an art museum in Ontario, and purchased the right to reproduce it as the book cover.'
    - 'Sandy arranged with the printer to produce several proofs before finalizing the production order. Two thousand copies of <i>Rain Cycle</i> were distributed according to Ms. Lodewick’s wishes.'

Jim and Sandy met in 2011 at the CODEX Book Fair in Berkeley, CA. The lone goose press broadside series resonated with Jim at the time he was looking for a new letterpress printer for his broadsides. After contacting Sandy in the spring of 2012 they agreed to collaborate on the 2012 poetry broadsides which included 4 broadsides and have been working together each year since. Typically there are 3 broadsides a year. lone goose press provides the option of digital as well as letterpress printing, allowing a wider range of imagery.

    - '<h6><b>"Tablet"</b> by Chris Dombrowski</h6>'
    - 'Jim was particularly struck by Dombrowski’s imagery of water and the "blue sky no one built", which find a symbolic reference in the arching blue brush stroke. The "emergent mayfly shaking his wings dry" is rendered graphically with a hint of vibration in the rendering. A metallic silver ink dusted with pearlescent dry pigment adds a subtle shimmer.'
    - '<h6><b>"River"</b> by Jay Leeming</h6>'
    - 'This is a hybrid print that combines letterpress printing with archival digital printing. The vibrant willow leaf and the blue brush strokes were printed digitally. The remaining graphics and typography were printed letterpress. The paper, Canal, was made by Saint Armand, a small mill in Montréal, Québec.'

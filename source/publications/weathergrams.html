      <p class="leader-1">Calligrapher and teacher Lloyd Reynolds developed the practice of “Weathergrams” in the early 1970s. It relates to a Japanese tradition of short informal poems exchanged among friends. A weathergram is a poem of ten words or less written on a strip of paper, then hung outdoors on a branch or bough to weather over a season, between solstice and equinox, or equinox to solstice. The poems are simple, spontaneous, and often refer to aspects of nature or the season.</p>
      <p>lone goose press began the tradition of the yearly weathergram in 2003.</p>

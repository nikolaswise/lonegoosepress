    <h3 class="trailer-2 leader-2">An annual weathergram is a lone goose press tradition.</h3>

    <p>As the year drew to a close, we were still casting about for a text. Then an unexpected freezing rain ice storm arrived on Dec 14, the ice persisting over five days.</p>

    <p class="font-size-0 trailer-2">After ice storm—Clear sky. Bare trees dazzling—Dreamlike</p>

    <p>While the freeze was challenging in many ways, we found the landscape incredibly beautiful with sunlight dancing on the trees.</p>

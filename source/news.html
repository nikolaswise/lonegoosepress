    <h3>An annual weathergram is a lone goose press tradition.</h3>

    <p>As the year drew to a close, we were still casting about for a text. Then an unexpected freezing rain ice storm arrived on Dec 14, the ice persisting over five days.</p>

    <p>After ice storm—Clear sky. Bare trees dazzling—Dreamlike</p>

    <p>While the freeze was challenging in many ways, we found the landscape incredibly beautiful with sunlight dancing on the trees.</p>

    <p>The weathergram is now on the press and due to be completed Fri, 6 January.</p>

    <p>If you would like one of the 2016 weathergrams, please send a stamped, self-addressed, standard #10 business envelope (4.125 x 9.5 in) to us here at the press (lone goose press, 2580 Augusta Street, Eugene, OR 97403). We wish you peace and beauty in the coming year.</p>

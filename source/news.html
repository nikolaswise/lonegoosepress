    <h3 class="trailer-2 leader-2">Opening the Mouth of the Dead</h3>

    <p>It has been an exciting journey over the past year as the design for Catherine Woodard’s poem cycle <i>Opening the Mouth of the Dead</i> has evolved. The publication date for both the trade edition and the limited-edition letterpress version has been set for September 2017. In the next few months we will be printing the text for the limited edition on the venerable Vandercook 219, and gearing up to reproduce Margot Thompson’s evocative artwork using photopolymer photogravure plates on the etching press. It is labor-intensive, but the results are worth it. Watch for progress updates as we move into the production phase.</p>

    <p>Participating in the CODEX 2017 exhibition in February was a heady experience. Beyond the glass walls of Craneway Pavilion near the port of Richmond, California, the gulls dipped and soared in endless conversation with the wind. Weather fronts passed, rain and fog prevailed over the bay. Inside, the depth and variety of the work on display was overwhelming. Artists from around the world explored the endless variety in which books and book-like artifacts can convey the trials of the heart and the journeys of the imagination. There were elegant traditional books executed with care and passion, alongside avant-garde structures with pages made of ceramic plates or laser-cut metal sheets. The exhibition brought together heart-rending works reaching for the deepest insights and utterances of poetry and myth, and playful, outrageous, sometimes unnerving explorations of the book as object, taking us to the edge. It was a privilege to share the work of lone goose press, and the opportunity to connect with other book artists was priceless, an inspiration for years to come. </p>

    <h3 class="trailer-2 leader-2">An annual weathergram is a lone goose press tradition.</h3>

    <p>As the year drew to a close, we were still casting about for a text. Then an unexpected freezing rain ice storm arrived on Dec 14, the ice persisting over five days.</p>

    <p>While the freeze was challenging in many ways, we found the landscape incredibly beautiful with sunlight dancing on the trees.</p>

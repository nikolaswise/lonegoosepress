It has been an exciting journey over the past year as the design for Catherine Woodard’s poem cycle Opening the Mouth of the Dead has evolved. The publication date for both the trade edition and the limited-edition letterpress version has been set for September 2017. In the next few months we will be printing the text for the limited edition on the venerable Vandercook 219, and gearing up to reproduce Margot Thompson’s evocative artwork using photopolymer photogravure plates on the etching press. It is labor-intensive, but the results are worth it. Watch for progress updates as we move into the production phase.

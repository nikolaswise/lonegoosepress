    <pre>
My guardian angel has shining eyes.
Sometimes I think she is indifferent,
but she has deep, amber shining eyes.
I am probably not her only client.
She has clear, insistent eyes
and amazing, jagged brown lips.

There are morning visitations,
when she shoves her black
bearlike muzzle into my face
to lick the sleepiness from my eyes.
I want her to teach me about
being awake, about being present
and having vision, perhaps
about being big and shaggy
and infinitely tender.
I am her guardian angel.
She is not my only client

      <pre>
Tell me why it is we don’t lift our voices these days
And cry over what is happening. Have you noticed
The plans are made for Iraq and the ice cap is melting?
I say to myself: “Go on, cry. What’s the sense
Of being an adult and having no voice? Cry out!
See who will answer! This is Call and Answer!”

We will have to call especially loud to reach
Our angels, who are hard of hearing; they are hiding
In the jugs of silence filled during our wars.

Have we agreed to so many wars that we can’t
Escape from silence? If we don’t lift our voices, we allow
Others (who are ourselves) to rob the house.

How come we’ve listened to the great criers—Neruda,
Akhmatova, Thoreau, Frederick Douglass—and now
We’re silent as sparrows in the little bushes?

Some masters say our life lasts only seven days.
Where are we in the week? Is it Thursday yet?
Hurry, cry now! Soon Sunday night will come.

      <pre>
Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed. This world in arms is not spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children. …This is not a way of life at all, in any true sense…it is humanity hanging from a cross of iron.

      <pre>
It would be a quieter holiday, no ﬁreworks
or loud parades, no speeches, no salutes to any ﬂag,
a day of staying home instead of crowding away,
a day we celebrate nothing gained in war
but what we’re given—how the sun’s warmth
is democratic, touching everyone,
and the rain is democratic too,
how the strongest branches in the wind
give themselves as they resist, resist
and give themselves, how birds could have no freedom
without the planet’s weight to wing against,
how Earth itself could come to be
only when a whirling cloud of dust
pledged allegiance as a world
circling dependently around a star, and the star
blossomed into ﬁre from the ash of other stars,
and once, at the dark zero of our time,
a blaze of revolutionary light
exploded out of nowhere, out of nothing,
because nothing needed the light,
as the brilliance of the light itself needs nothing.

      <pre>
As I’m walking down the street,
Darkness closes ‘round my feet,
Still at noon and stars are bright,
Just one thin ring of sun sheds light

Stars appear and fireflies gleam
Is this real or a crazy dream?
Moon is powerful for a day,
Blocking the light of the sun away

One small thing hides all we see,
Real life hidden in obscurity,
What spot eclipses your real-world view?
What moon conceals the sun that’s you?

We belong to a mystery that does not belong to us, yet it is freely granted, everywhere and all the time.  We distance ourselves, we fail to see, but the mystery does not fail us.  It spirals through the molecules of our own DNA, through the shells of snails and the chambered nautilus, through the twisting grain of junipers and the great spinning storms and the spiral arms of the Milky Way, and so joins itself to the infinite from which it arose.

You can’t have each day unfold exactly as you expect.

You can’t stop the earth’s warming or grow back the rainforests by next Tuesday.

You can’t change someone by giving them sage advice.

You can’t have the world as it was.

But—

You can have a snowy morning in April.

You can have the ministry of silence that gives birth to furious clattering hailstorms.

You can rejoice with outrageous skunk cabbage congregations.

You can have each moment if you choose to be present.

You already knew that. Reaching down,
Scooping and shaping with bare hands,
Absorbed and entranced with the dark,
Grainy soil that clings to your skin, you know
In your bones the boundless mystery
Reaching back thousands of years
In this patch of prairie where we have camped
For the past thirty-four. You know
There is a connection I miss
With my practical gloves
And long-handled tools, an ancient
Wisdom that seeps into your blood,
Carrying countless generations
Of grass-songs and oak-stories.
You touch an ancient prairie-fire
Of gratitude, a rough blessing
You carry in your blood as you work
On hands and knees,
Teasing out the roots of weeds,
Tending the delicate future.

      <pre>
Of the three of us, it was my grandmother who preserved the photographs, as automatically diligent as if she were canning garden vegetables to carry us through the white worst months of winter. The albums even had their own sort of cellar: the dark and dust beneath the bed my father and I shared. Gee gosh, someday—the announcement always meant under-the-bed diving was being done, she was retrieving one or another album in which to put this year’s school picture of me as a startlingly pompadoured sixth-grader or one of my father in unbuckled overshoes beside his latest obstetrical miracle, triplet purebred Hereford calves, or of Grandma herself posed beside the Jeep with her beloved but fidgety sheepdogs, Spot and Tip, ambivalently atop the hood.

All said and done, a photograph is a knowing wink from the eye of time.

The river is famous to the fish.

The loud voice is famous to silence,
which knew it would inherit the earth
before anybody said so.

The cat sleeping on the fence is famous to the birds
watching him from the birdhouse.

The tear is famous, briefly, to the cheek.

The idea you carry close to your bosom
is famous to your bosom.

The boot is famous to the earth,
more famous than the dress shoe,
which is famous only to floors.

The bent photograph is famous to the one who carries it
and not at all famous to the one who is pictured.

I want to be famous to shuffling men
who smile while crossing streets,
sticky children in grocery lines,
famous as the one who smiled back.

I want to be famous in the way a pulley is famous,
or a buttonhole, not because it did anything spectacular,
but because it never forgot what it could do.

We were contracted with the prison crew
    to take the ridge. Tear it down.
 Trees, Scotch broom, fence posts.
    It was too hot to smoke cigarettes.
 My chainsaw touched a whole world
    of yellow jackets in a beetle-rotten stump
 and my skin went tight. I lay facedown
    in the duff after the crew boss shot me
 full of something he kept in his saw bag.
    An inmate carried half a hunting dog
 like an armful of cedar bolts
    from the last stand of brush.
 What was left was swollen with ants.
    The vise in my throat bore down,
 daylight broke its bones across the ridge.
    Tear it down. From there you could see
 the whole town. Tear it down, tear it down.

      <pre>
Almost everything I know is glad
to be born—not only the desert orangetip,
on the twist flower or tansy, shaking
birth moisture from its wings, but also the naked
warbler nestling, head wavering toward sky,
and the honey possum, the pygmy possum,
blind, hairless thimbles of forward,
press and part.

Almost everything I’ve seen pushes
toward the place of that state as if there were
no knowing any other—the violent crack
and seed-propelling shot of the witch hazel pod,
the philosophy implicit in the inside out
seed-thrust of the wood sorrel. All hairy
saltcedar seeds are single-minded
in their grasping of wind and spinning
for luck toward birth by water.

And I’m fairly shocked to consider
all the bludgeonings and batterings going on
continually, the head-rammings, wing-furors,
and beak-crackings, fighting for release
inside gelatinous shells, leather shells,
calcium shells or rough, horny shells. Legs
and shoulder, knees and elbows flail likewise
against their womb walls everywhere, in pine
forest niches, seepage banks and boggy
prairies, among savannah grasses, on woven
mats and perfumed linen sheets.

Mad zealots, every one, even before
beginning they are dark dust-congealings
of pure frenzy to come into light.

Almost everything I know rages to be born,
the obsession founding itself explicitly
in the coming bone harps and ladders,
the heart-thrusts, vessels and voices
of all those speeding with clear and total
fury toward this singular honor.

      <h3 class="leader-2" id="our-flag">Our Flag</h3>
      <pre>
Our flag
should be green
to represent an ocean.
It should have two stars
in the first canton,
for us and navigation.
They should be of gold thread,
placed diagonally,
and not solid,
but comprised of lines.
Our flag should be silky jet.
It should have a wound,
a red river the sun must ford
when flown at half-mast.
It should have the first letter
of every alphabet ever.
When folded into a triangle
an embroidered eighth note
should rest on top
or an odd-pinnate,
with an argentine stem,
a fiery leaf, a small branch
signifying the impossible song.
Or maybe honey and blue
with a centered white pinion.
Our flag should be a veil
that makes the night weep
when it comes to dance,
a birthday present we open
upon death, the abyss we sleep
under. Our flag should hold
failure like light glinting
in a headdress of water.
It should hold the moon
as the severed head
of a white animal
and we should carry it
to hospitals and funerals,
to police stations and law offices.
It should live, divided,
deepening its yellows
and reds, flaunting itself
in a dead gray afternoon sky.
Our flag should be seen
at weddings well after
we’ve departed.
It should stir in the heat
above the tables and music.
It should watch our friends
join and separate
and laugh as they go out
under the clouded night
for cold air and cigarettes.
Our flag should sing
when we cannot,
praise when we cannot,
rejoice when we cannot.
Let it be a reminder.
Let it be the aperture,
the net, the rope of dark stars.
Let it be mathematics.
Let it be the eloquence
of the process shining
on the page, a beacon
on the edge of a continent.
Let its warnings be dismissed.
Let it be insignificant
and let its insignificance shine.

      <pre>
The world begins at a kitchen table. No matter what, we must eat to live.

The gifts of earth are brought and prepared, set on the table. So it has been since creation, and it will go on.

We chase chickens or dogs away from it. Babies teethe at the corners. They scrape their knees under it.

It is here that children are given instructions on what it means to be human. We make men at it, we make women.

At this table we gossip, recall enemies and the ghosts of lovers.

Our dreams drink coffee with us as they put their arms around our children. They laugh with us at our poor falling-down selves and as we put ourselves back together once again at the table.

This table has been a house in the rain, an umbrella in the sun.

Wars have begun and ended at this table. It is a place to hide in the shadow of terror. A place to celebrate the terrible victory.

We have given birth on this table, and have prepared our parents for burial here.

At this table we sing with joy, with sorrow. We pray of suffering and remorse. We give thanks.

Perhaps the world will end at the kitchen table, while we are laughing and crying, eating of the last sweet bite.

Flake by flake
falling softly,
covering the ground in a white blanket.
The trees whisper in the wind—
snow, snow, snow they seem to say.
Smoke is billowing from chimneys into the cloudless sky.
A soft whoosh of the wind—
I watch. I listen.
I look at the setting sun.
It goes down
like a melting ice cream cone.
Through the fog I can see the ocean lapping up the sand.
The moon rises.
I get into bed
as I hear the chimes of winter.
I shut my eyes
and go to sleep.

      <pre>
I’m cutting my swallows from black silk,
China’s best, Father, so that when flying
they meet with the least amount of resistance
and thank you again for the abundance
of insects over the green rice fields
this evening, the water bumpy with frog eyes
reflecting a pink west-flowing sky.

Now, I’m sewing into the material
my red heart because the dead lately
have been a little noisy in my sleep
and about this prayer, Father,
I don’t want any confusion—

I’m mud deep here
in love and would like to stay on
a while longer at least until I get the sun right,
its light over the rim of the bowl
we all eat from, and to watching,
while I’m at it, the little spot fires
appearing over the back of my hands—
my age, a quiet invitation
to bird watching
where light around the grey heron,
alone in the water,
dies down, in time, to black
and what the imagination can rescue.

We believe in the imagination and in the variety of its architectures, not in one plan for all, even if it is God’s plan. We believe in the divinity of life, in all its human variety. We believe that everything can be remembered in time, that anyone may be redeemed, that no hierarchy is worth figuring out, that no flower or animal or body of water or star is common, that poetry is the key to a lock worth springing, that what is called for is not subjugation but genuflection.

We trace the line of our testament back beyond Agamemnon, past Ur, past the roots of the spoken to handprints blown on a wall. We cannot be done away with, any more than the history of the Sung dynasty can be done away with, traveling as it does as a beam of coherent light far beyond our ken. We cannot, finally, be imprisoned or killed, because we remember and speak.

We are not twelve or twenty but numerous as the motes of dust lining the early morning shafts of city light. We are unquenchable and stark in the same moment that we are ordinary. We incorporate damage and compassion, exaltation and weariness-to-the-bone.
